Stackbit is a composable visual editor that supports multiple content sources and site frameworks. Contentlayer can be used in sites that are Stackbit-enabled to ease the process for developers working with content in their components and pages.

Contentlayer provides a method for [transforming Stackbit configuration into Contentlayer configuration](/docs/reference/experimental-source-files-stackbit), so you only have to define the shape of your content in one place.

## How it Works

With the appropriate packages installed, the process works like this:

1. Define the shape of your documents using [Stackbit's `models` property](https://docs.stackbit.com/reference/config/content-modeling/models).
1. Import Stackbit config object into the Contentlayer configuration file.
1. Extend any necessary properties to support your code.
1. Configure the Contentlayer source.

See below for an example, and also view [the API reference](/docs/reference/experimental-source-files-stackbit) for specific usage details.

## Example Project

If you'd like to see this in process, check out [this example project](https://github.com/stackbit-themes/stackbit-examples/tree/main/contentlayer), which integrates Stackbit and Contentlayer in a Next.js site.

The README file has setup information, but we recommend reading through the tutorial below to understand how the pieces fit together.

## Quick Tutorial

We can demonstrate how this works through a simple example. In this scenario, we have a `Page` model with a required `title` field.

The content lives in a `content/pages` directory, and we want to use each page's file path as the URL path to that page, which we'll store in a computed `urlPath` property on the compiled data (via the Contentlayer build process).

Let's assume:

- The content is stored in markdown files in a `content/pages` directory. (Note that only files-source is supported by this approach.)
- We're using Next.js as the site framework, which is the primary framework for which Contentlayer is optimized.

### Setup

First, make sure the dependencies are installed in the project:

```txt
npm install contentlayer next-contentlayer @contentlayer/experimental-source-files-stackbit
```

### Stackbit Configuration

In Stackbit, document type definitions are referred to as _models_ and are defined using [the `models` property](https://docs.stackbit.com/reference/config/content-modeling/models).

A simple Stackbit config might look something like this:

```ts
// stackbit.config.ts

import type * as Stackbit from '@stackbit/sdk'

const stackbitConfig: Stackbit.RawConfig = {
  stackbitVersion: '~0.6.0',
  cmsName: 'git',
  ssgName: 'nextjs',
  nodeVersion: '16',
  dataDir: 'content/data',
  pagesDir: 'content/pages',
  models: {
    Page: {
      type: 'page',
      hideContent: true,
      urlPath: '/{slug}',
      fields: [
        {
          type: 'string',
          name: 'title',
          default: 'This is a new page',
          required: true,
        },
      ],
    },
  },
}

export default stackbitConfig
```

<Callout>
  Note that best practice generally leads to breaking up each object in the `models` property into individual files, but
  are combined here for context.
</Callout>

### Extend Models

In the Contentlayer configuration file, we can import the Stackbit config, and then add our computed `urlPath` property.

```ts
import { stackbitConfigToDocumentTypes } from '@contentlayer/experimental-source-files-stackbit'
import stackbitConfig from './stackbit.config.js'

const documentTypes = stackbitConfigToDocumentTypes(stackbitConfig, {
  documentTypes: {
    Page: {
      computedFields: {
        url: {
          type: 'string',
          resolve: (doc) => doc._raw.flattenedPath.replace(/^pages\/?/, '/'),
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

<Callout>
  Notice that we didn't have to define the `title` field. We also didn't have to define properties like `name` or
  `filePathPattern` on the models, as they were already inferred by this function.
</Callout>

### Configure the Source

At this point, we have everything we need to call `makeSource` and start using Contentlayer build output from Stackbit configuration.

```ts
import { makeSource } from 'contentlayer/source-files'
import { stackbitConfigToDocumentTypes } from '@contentlayer/experimental-source-files-stackbit'
import stackbitConfig from './stackbit.config.js'

const documentTypes = stackbitConfigToDocumentTypes(stackbitConfig, {
  // document type extensions ...
})

export default makeSource({ contentDirPath: 'content', documentTypes })
```

Now you can build files by running `contentlayer build` in your project!

<Callout>
  We recommend using [`withContentlayer`](/docs/reference/next-contentlayer#withcontentlayer) when using Next.js to run
  `contentlayer dev` in sync with `next dev`.
