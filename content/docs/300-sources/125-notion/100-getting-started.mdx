  âš  The content source plugin `contentlayer-notion-source` is currently in Alpha and should not be used in production.
</div>

This plugin allows you to use Notion as a content source. It automatically generates type by inferring your page properties and transform Rich Text into HTML.

---

## 1. Install dependencies

```txt
npm install contentlayer-source-notion
```

## 2. Define databases

A database in Notion is a list of pages with a set of defined properties.

The power of this plugin is that you do not have to define a schema, the database properties are automatically inferred to generate it for you.

```js
// contentlayer.config.js

import { makeSource, defineDatabase } from 'contentlayer-source-notion'

export const Post = defineDatabase(() => ({
  name: 'Post',
  databaseId: '<databaseId>',
}))

export default makeSource({
  documentTypes: [Post],
})
```
